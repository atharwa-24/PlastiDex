# PlastiDex

##Inspiration
Plastic. A useful polymer but harmful one at the same time. Plastic recycling is a must to conserve our environment and decrease the unethical disturbances caused due to plastic disposals. Our project aims to create a better understanding among people about which exact plastic are they using and to help them identify a way to dispose it in a eco-friendly manner.

##Overview
An efficient tool that uses convolutional neural networks in order to detect the code on plastic materials and gives further information on how to dispose, hoe many times to use and what must be avoided.

##Summary
This project mainly aims to promote recycling. It helps people understand their plastic and dispose it effectively and in a eco-friendly manner.

##Conclusion
With the amount of misinformation spreading and the climate clock ticking, it is our responsibility to inform people and to protect our environment. This project will help people in understanding what is necessary. It will create a certain awareness amongst people and can be further turned into a competition of sorts with a leaderboard, promoting recycling in a fun way. Till the day we are completely plastic free, we can at least recycle and responsibly dispose off the ones we do not need.
